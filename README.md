# Movie-web-scraper
My in-progress Java project by using API, I hope to be able to search movies via genre and other factors. Currently, the only part of this project completed was a connection test to an API and the ability to search for a movie and get its genres. 
The current API I am using is OMDb API, not created by me, only utilized by me.
